## Overview:
This project aims to predict the purity and price of honey using unsupervised machine learning techniques. By leveraging clustering algorithms such as KMeans, DBSCAN, BIRCH, and OPTICS, we segment the honey dataset into distinct groups based on various characteristics. The analysis involves exploring the data, preprocessing steps, applying clustering algorithms, evaluating model performance, and deriving actionable insights for stakeholders in the honey industry.

## Objectives:
- Segment the honey dataset using unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
- Determine the appropriate number of clusters.
- Identify the characteristics of each cluster.

## Data Description:
- **Data Source:** Kaggle (Predict Purity and Price of Honey)
  - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/predict-purity-and-price-of-honey)
- **Size:** 15.8 MB
- **Records:** 247,903 rows
- **Columns:** 11 variables including index, categorical (Pollen_analysis), and non-categorical (CS, Density, WC, pH, EC, F, G, Viscosity, Purity, Price).

## Analysis:
- **Data Pre-Processing:**
  - Missing data treatment
  - Outlier detection and treatment
  - Numeric coding of data
- **Clustering Analysis:**
  - Application of KMeans, DBSCAN, BIRCH, and OPTICS algorithms
  - Evaluation of model performance using silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index
- **Statistical Tests:**
  - ANOVA to analyze the impact of variables on honey purity and price
  - Chi-square test for association between categorical variables and honey purity

## Findings and Insights:
- Three clusters were identified as the most suitable segmentation for the honey dataset.
- Price emerged as a significant factor influencing honey purity and price.
- Other variables such as viscosity, density, pH, etc., did not significantly contribute to differences in honey purity.
- Statistical tests indicated a lack of significant association between certain variables and honey purity.

## Managerial Insights:
- Each cluster represents a unique group of honey samples with varying characteristics, highlighting the heterogeneity in honey products.
- Understanding the relationship between price and purity is crucial for pricing strategies and market positioning.
- While certain factors may not directly impact honey purity, they could still be relevant for other aspects of product differentiation or quality assurance.

## Results:
- The KMeans algorithm with k=3 clusters provided the best segmentation based on silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.
- ANOVA results indicated significant differences in price across different groups, while other variables did not show significant impact on honey purity.
- Chi-square test results revealed no significant association between certain categorical variables and honey purity.

## Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into predicting honey purity and price using unsupervised machine learning techniques. By segmenting the dataset into clusters and analyzing the factors influencing honey characteristics, we offer actionable insights for stakeholders in the honey industry to optimize pricing strategies, product differentiation, and quality assurance measures.
